# Impact of Gerrymandering on the 2018 Midterm Elections

Partisan gerrymandering is a peril to democratic elections in the United States. Given the lack of comprehensive, quantitative analysis of gerrymandering on the national level, this research aims to develop a model that assesses the impact of gerrymandering in every state and aggregates the results to determine the net effects of gerrymandering on the 2018 midterm elections. To this end, I simulated election outcomes for each state on an ensemble of congressional redistricting plans. Additionally, I developed methods to impute congressional election outcomes for uncontested races and model election results using population demographic data. Finally, I was able quantitatively identify states with potential gerrymandering in the 2018 midterm elections and evaluate the net impact of gerrymandering on the national level.
